# 🛡️ PRIVACY POLICY — Recent Bookmarks Browser Extension

Last updated: December 4, 2025

Recent Bookmarks is a browser extension designed to help users quickly view and search their recently added bookmarks. This extension prioritizes user privacy and does not collect or transmit any personal data.

1. Information We Collect

We do NOT collect any personal information.
The extension does not track users, does not log activity, and does not use analytics.

The only data the extension accesses is:

Bookmarks

    The extension reads your browser bookmarks so it can display and search them inside the popup.

    This access is required for core functionality.

Local Settings

    The extension stores your preferences (e.g., dark mode, time range filters) using the browser’s storage API.

    These settings are stored locally on your device only.

2. Information We Do Not Collect

The Recent Bookmarks extension does not collect:

    Personal data

    Browsing history

    Usage statistics

    Bookmark contents or URLs outside your device

    Device identifiers

    IP addresses

    Any data stored by other websites or extensions

We do not use:

    Analytics

    Cookies

    Third-party scripts

    Tracking technologies

3. Data Storage

All data processed by the extension stays entirely on your device.

The extension does not transmit any data to external servers or to the developer.

4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or transfer any data to third parties.
We do not share data with advertisers, analytics providers, or external companies.

No data ever leaves your browser.

5. Permissions Used

The extension uses two permissions:

These settings are stored locally on your machine.

6. How to Delete Your Data
